h1. Overview

@quick_unit@ is a *very* clean and simple C++ Unit Test framework.

Yes... another one ;-)

It has 3 fundamental design goals:

# A single header file contains everything. No libraries or supporting C++ files needed.
# Tests must be trivially easy to create, with absolute minimum ceremony.
# Cross platform

h2. Example

<pre><code>#include "quick_unit.hpp"

DECLARE_SUITE(MyFirstTests)

TEST("the compiler can add") {
  assert(3 == 1 + 2, SHOULD(add numbers));
}

TEST("the compiler can subtract") {
  assert_equal(1 , 2 - 1, SHOULD(subtract numbers));
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  return MyFirstTests.RunAll();
}
</code></pre>

The SHOULD elements are optional, but you _should_ use them...

h1. Installation

Just copy @quick_unit.hpp@ into your project.

h1. Excuses

It's not big.

It's not clever.

It's just supposed to let me write unit tests without getting in the way.

h1. Motivation

I spent decades programming in C++ and didn't know any better. 

Then I found Ruby and it bent my mind. It changed completely the way I think about programming. Thanks Matz. Thanks Dave Thomas.

I now favour code clarity over clever complexity. 

I insist on test first / test driven programming. Even in C++. Especially in C++!!!!!

@quick_unit@ is my response to having to go back to a C++ project and not being able to find a zero-impedance unit test framework.

Some came close, and I resisted for a while, but I could not find any existing code that gave me the ability to 'just write it'. I hope that is what is achieved in @quick_unit@ and that it is so easy to use that no-one will have an excuse to skip their tests.

h1. Platforms 

Tested on:

 *  Visual Studio 2010
 *  Visual Studio 2005
 *  MinGW GCC (5.16)
 *  Debian Linux

Example files are held in the repository to show examples of tests on differing platforms.

The MinGW and Linux versions are built using Netbeans and emit results in the Netbeans 'Simple Test' format. They therefore integrate well as standalone tests within an overall C++ project.
